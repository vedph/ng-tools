# NgTools

My essential, general-purpose tools for Angular applications.

These are the typical services and tools shared by most of my Angular apps. For convenience, I packed them into a single reusable library having no dependencies other than Angular `CommonModule`.

- pipes: safe HTML pipe to embed HTML code into a page.
- services: environment settings from an external JS file, error handling service, local storage wrapper.
- validators: strict min-length validator, conditional validator.
- general: deep copy function, Roman numbers bidirectional converter.

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.0.
